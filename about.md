you can do it!!!

Spawns an image of your choice (Mr. Jim M. Boree by default) when you've almost passed your new best. Comes with optional SFX as well.

For obvious reasons, platformer levels are not supported.

Mod suggested by [Mr_JimBoree](https://nitter.net/Mr_JimBoree)/[holyguacamole34](https://nitter.net/holyguacamole34).

Includes PNG and GIF support out of the box, as well as optional SFX.

Additional thanks to [Nwo5](https://github.com/nwo5-trg) for letting me finish this mod in some form.

For those wondering why this mod took longer than expected, go ask Nwo5's parents why they decided to be such jerks.
